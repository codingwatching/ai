A **harness adapter** is the second axis of a sandboxed run: it decides _which
coding agent runs_ and translates that agent's work back into `chat()` stream
chunks. The [provider](./providers) decides _where_ the agent runs; the harness
decides _what_ runs. Both sit behind the same `chat()` + `withSandbox()` wiring,
so you can swap a harness without touching your provider or [workspace](./workspace).

Every harness adapter declares `requires: [SandboxCapability]`, so `chat()` fails
fast at the call site unless a sandbox is provided via `withSandbox(...)`.

## Built-in harness adapters

Each agent has its own package with curated per-model metadata. Pass the adapter
to `chat({ adapter })` and run it under any provider.

| Harness | Package | Adapter | Auth env |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Grok Build](../adapters/grok-build) | `@tanstack/ai-grok-build` | `grokBuildText` | `XAI_API_KEY` (or grok.com login on local-process) |
| [Claude Code](../adapters/claude-code) | `@tanstack/ai-claude-code` | `claudeCodeText` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `claude login`) |
| [Codex](../adapters/codex) | `@tanstack/ai-codex` | `codexText` | `CODEX_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) |
| [OpenCode](../adapters/opencode) | `@tanstack/ai-opencode` | `opencodeText` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (model-dependent) |

```ts
import { chat } from '@tanstack/ai'
import { grokBuildText } from '@tanstack/ai-grok-build'
import { withSandbox } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox'
import { sandbox } from './sandbox'
import { messages } from './chat-context'

const stream = chat({
  adapter: grokBuildText('grok-build'),
  messages,
  middleware: [withSandbox(sandbox)],
})
```

## Any ACP agent (`acpCompatible`)

Many coding agents speak the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com)
(ACP) — `pi`, `gemini --acp`, and [dozens of others](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents).
For any of them that doesn't have a dedicated package, `acpCompatible` (from
`@tanstack/ai-acp`) builds a harness adapter on the spot — the harness equivalent
of `openaiCompatible`. Configure how to launch it once, then run it under any
provider like the built-in adapters:

```ts
import { acpCompatible } from '@tanstack/ai-acp'

const pi = acpCompatible({
  name: 'pi',
  models: ['pi-fast', 'pi-pro'],
  command: ({ model, harnessCwd }) => `pi --acp -m ${model} --cwd ${harnessCwd}`,
  authMethodId: 'pi-api-key',
})
```

See the [ACP-Compatible Harness](../adapters/acp-compatible) guide for the full
config (typed models, per-call `modelOptions`, WebSocket transports, permissions,
and protocol coverage). For which agents you can plug in, browse the official
**[ACP agents list](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/agents)** and the
**[ACP registry](https://agentclientprotocol.com/get-started/registry)**.

## Where to go next

- **[Providers](./providers)** — where the harness runs (local, Docker, Daytona, Vercel).
- **[Tools](./tools)** — bridge your app's own tools into the in-sandbox agent.
- **[Events & File Hooks](./events)** — stream the agent's edits and activity to a UI.
