/**
 * OpenCode workspace projector — mirrors the Claude Code reference
 * implementation at `packages/ai-claude-code/src/adapters/projection.ts`.
 *
 * `withSandbox` surfaces a portable `WorkspaceProjection` (skills, plugins, a
 * secret resolver, and a one-time marker path) via a capability. This adapter
 * reads it in `chatStream` setup and projects workspace inputs into OpenCode's
 * native format:
 *
 *   - MCP servers   → `opencode.json` at the workspace root (mcp section).
 *                     Written on EVERY call (never marker-gated) so rotated
 *                     secrets always re-apply.
 *   - gitSkill repos → OpenCode has no recognised skills directory; we
 *                      warn-and-skip rather than invent a path.
 *   - agentSkill    → no bare-name primitive in opencode; warn-and-skip.
 *   - plugins       → opencode has no `opencode plugin install` command;
 *                     warn-and-skip.
 *
 * The `opencode.json` mcp-section shape mirrors the `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`
 * shape already used by the adapter's host-tool-bridge, ensuring both
 * mechanisms use the same server-entry schema:
 *
 *   ```json
 *   { "mcp": { "<name>": { "type": "remote", "url": "...", "enabled": true,
 *                           "headers": { ... } } } }
 *   ```
 *
 * OpenCode merges project-scoped `opencode.json` with its environment config,
 * so the workspace file coexists safely with the runtime `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`
 * env written for the host-tool-bridge.
 *
 * External-convention caveat: the `opencode.json` location and the `remote`
 * MCP-entry shape are derived from the adapter's existing `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`
 * usage. Where OpenCode has no clean primitive (gitSkill dir, agentSkill,
 * plugins) we no-op with a warning instead of fabricating a command.
