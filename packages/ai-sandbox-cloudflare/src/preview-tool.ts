/**
 * The browser-preview capability, as reusable building blocks rather than
 * per-app glue: a `chat()` server tool that mints a preview URL for a dev server
 * running inside the sandbox, plus the system-prompt guidance an agent needs to
 * produce a preview that works.
 *
 * Previews go over a **Cloudflare quick tunnel** (`sandbox.tunnels.get(port)` →
 * `https://<name>.trycloudflare.com`), served by `cloudflared` INSIDE the sandbox.
 * We deliberately do NOT use `exposePort` + `proxyToSandbox` here: that routes the
 * preview through the Worker's own origin, which in local dev is the example's Vite
 * dev server — and Vite's middleware then serves the preview's module/asset
 * requests (`/@vite/client`, `/src/*`, `/@fs/*`) from the HOST instead of the
 * container, breaking the page. A tunnel bypasses the Vite port entirely, needs no
 * custom domain on a deploy, and forwards WebSockets (so the app's HMR works).
 *
 * Both exports belong to THIS package because the transport is its concern, not any
 * particular app's. Wire them explicitly into your agent:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import {
 *   exposePreviewTool,
 *   PREVIEW_GUIDANCE,
 * } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent'
 *
 * createCloudflareSandboxAgent({
 *   adapter: () => claudeCodeText('sonnet'),
 *   tools: (input, env) => [exposePreviewTool(input, env)],
 *   systemPrompts: [PREVIEW_GUIDANCE],
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Workers-only (imports `@cloudflare/sandbox`) — exported from the `/agent` entry.
