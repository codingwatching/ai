# Cloudflare sandbox — TanStack Start app (Worker + Durable Objects + Container)

A reference **TanStack Start app** that runs a TanStack AI sandbox agent on the
edge — UI, agent, Durable Objects, and the container all ship in **one Cloudflare
Worker, one `wrangler deploy`**.

> **The demo:** ask the agent to _build a self-contained TanStack Start app_
> (a kanban board, a data dashboard, a small game…). It calls a bridged host tool
> (`tanstackStartRecipe`) for the current scaffolding recipe, builds the app inside
> the sandbox container, installs deps, starts the dev server, and hands back a live
> **preview URL** (a Cloudflare quick tunnel). The app it builds needs **no env,
> keys, or external services**, so the preview works for anyone — an agent shipping
> a running app on the edge with zero config.

> **One app, three harnesses.** A header dropdown picks which coding agent runs
> in the sandbox — **`claude-code`** (default), **`codex`**, or **`grok`** (the
> `HARNESS` var is the fallback default). The run-log / WebSocket / tool-bridge
> topology is adapter-agnostic, so only the adapter and the injected API key
> change. The container image ships all three CLIs — see
> [Choosing the harness](#choosing-the-harness).

The agent itself is still **one function call**:
`createCloudflareSandboxAgent()` (from `@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent`)
returns the run-coordinator Durable Object, the `@cloudflare/sandbox` Sandbox DO,
and a stateless Worker fetch handler. `src/agent.ts` configures it — the adapter
is resolved per run, so the UI's choice (or the `HARNESS` default) selects it:

```ts
import { createCloudflareSandboxAgent } from '@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/agent'
import { claudeCodeText } from '@tanstack/ai-claude-code'
import { codexText } from '@tanstack/ai-codex'
import { grokBuildText } from '@tanstack/ai-grok-build'

const HARNESSES = {
  'claude-code': () => claudeCodeText('sonnet'),
  codex: () =>
    codexText('gpt-5.3-codex', { sandboxMode: 'danger-full-access' }),
  grok: () => grokBuildText('grok-build-0.1'),
}

export const agent = createCloudflareSandboxAgent({
  // input.metadata.harness (from the UI) wins; else the HARNESS env default.
  adapter: (input, env) => HARNESSES[resolveHarness(input, env)](),
  tools: () => [tanstackStartRecipe], // optional chat() server tools, bridged over MCP
})
```

…and `src/server.ts` — the custom Cloudflare entry point — re-exports the DO
classes and composes the agent with the Start request handler so both live in one
Worker:

```ts
import handler from '@tanstack/react-start/server-entry'
import { proxyToSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox'
import { agent } from './agent'

export const RunCoordinator = agent.Coordinator // wrangler DO binding
export const Sandbox = agent.Sandbox // wrangler container binding

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const proxied = await proxyToSandbox(request, env) // sandbox preview ports
    if (proxied) return proxied
    const { pathname } = new URL(request.url)
    // The agent owns /runs, /_bridge, /tool-exec; everything else is the UI.
    if (isAgentPath(pathname) && agent.worker.fetch)
      return agent.worker.fetch(request, env, ctx)
    return handler.fetch(request) // TanStack Start SSR + /api/* routes
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler
```

The browser uses a vanilla `useChat` against the `/api/run` server route, which
bridges the agent's POST-then-WebSocket protocol to the SSE stream `useChat`
expects (see `src/routes/api.run.ts`).

Under the hood: a stateless Worker _triggers_ a run and returns immediately, a
Durable Object _coordinator_ drives the run to completion (surviving
hibernation), and clients _stream_ the result over a WebSocket with **resumable
cursors** so a reconnect never loses or replays an event. All of that lives inside
`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare`.

## DO-drives vs. co-located: where `chat()` runs

This example uses the **default `do-drives` model**: the coordinator Durable
Object runs `chat()` itself and serves the MCP tool-bridge from its own `fetch`
handler; the container only runs the coding-agent CLI. The whole MCP protocol
crosses the container→DO boundary.

`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare` also supports a **`colocated` model** (pass
`mode: 'colocated'` + a `runInContainerHarness` container program from
`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/runner`): the harness loop **and** the bridge run
_inside_ the container, and only host-tool **execution** crosses back. That keeps
the MCP transport on container localhost at the cost of a second build target
(the in-container runner must be bundled into the image). The DO-drives path is
the simpler one to teach and run, so it's what this example shows; see
`docs/sandbox/overview.md` ("Edge execution: two models") for the full tradeoff.

---

## Choosing the harness

One app runs any of three in-sandbox coding agents. The container image bakes in
all three CLIs, so switching never rebuilds the image — pick one live in the UI,
or set the `HARNESS` default for headless/deployed runs.

| `HARNESS`     | Adapter                           | Secret to set                         | Notes                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude-code` | `claudeCodeText('sonnet')`        | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                   | Default.                                                   |
| `codex`       | `codexText('gpt-5.3-codex', …)`   | `CODEX_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) | Runs with `sandboxMode: 'danger-full-access'` — see below. |
| `grok`        | `grokBuildText('grok-build-0.1')` | `XAI_API_KEY` (or `GROK_API_KEY`)     | —                                                          |

**Switch it live in the UI** — the header has a harness dropdown. Picking one
forwards `metadata: { harness }` on the run trigger; `resolveHarness` in
`src/agent.ts` reads it (per-run override), falling back to the `HARNESS` var
(`wrangler.jsonc` for deploys / `.dev.vars` locally), then `claude-code`.
Switching starts a **fresh thread** (new sandbox + clean conversation), since the
container's injected key and the running agent are per-harness. Only the chosen
harness's key is injected into the sandbox — set the keys you want available.

> The `metadata` lane is a generic per-run pass-through on `StartRunInput`
> (forwarded verbatim to the app's resolvers, never persisted) — not
> harness-specific. The HTTP `POST /runs` API accepts it too:
> `{ "metadata": { "harness": "codex" }, … }`.

> **Why codex needs `danger-full-access`:** codex's default `workspace-write` mode
> wraps every shell command in its own OS sandbox (bubblewrap), which needs to
> create a new user namespace — and the Cloudflare container forbids that
> (`bwrap: No permissions to create a new namespace`). The container is already the
> isolation boundary, so codex's redundant inner sandbox is disabled. Claude Code
> and Grok need no equivalent flag.

## Why this shape?

A normal request/response handler holds the HTTP connection open for the whole
agent run. That does not work at the edge: a Worker invocation is short-lived
and tied to one request, and a multi-minute agent loop will outlive it. The fix
is to **invert** the model — separate _triggering_ a run from _driving_ it. The
factory builds exactly this topology for you:

```
                      POST /runs  (trigger)            GET /runs/:id/stream  (tail)
                           │                                   │

```

Everything in the two boxes above is implemented in
`@tanstack/ai-sandbox-cloudflare`; the sections below explain how it behaves.

---

## How the Worker does NOT hang

`POST /runs` makes a single RPC into the coordinator, which opens the run-log,
kicks off `chat()` **without awaiting it**, registers the driving promise with
`ctx.waitUntil(done)`, arms a watchdog alarm, and returns `{ runId }`. The agent
loop is **not** awaited by the Worker: the `202` is sent the moment the run is
_registered_, and the Worker invocation ends. The Durable Object keeps running
the agent in the background because the outstanding `ctx.waitUntil` promise keeps
the instance alive until the run is terminal.

The run-log pump **never rejects**: a thrown stream error is recorded as a
`RUN_ERROR` event plus the run record's `error` field, so there is nothing to
throw back to a caller that no longer exists — failures are always observable by
tailing clients.

## How streaming resumes from a cursor

Every `StreamChunk` the agent emits is appended to a durable, `seq`-indexed log
persisted in DO storage. A client tails it:

```
GET /runs/:id/stream?threadId=<thread>&lastSeq=<n>
```

The coordinator accepts a **hibernatable** WebSocket (`ctx.acceptWebSocket`),
replays everything after `lastSeq` from storage, then live-tails to the terminal
event. The socket's cursor is stashed with `serializeAttachment` so it survives
hibernation; on reconnect the client sends its last-seen `seq` and the server
replays exactly what was missed — no gaps, no duplicates. Because the events
live in storage (not in any open stream), a dropped connection, a new browser
tab, or an evicted coordinator all reconnect cleanly. `GET /runs/:id` (without
`/stream`) is a non-streaming **poll fallback** that just returns the record.

## How the tool-bridge is served from the DO (no TCP listener)

`chat()`-provided **server tools** (the `tools` you pass the factory) are exposed
to the in-sandbox agent as an MCP server. On a long-running host that bridge is a
`node:http` listener — which is exactly what you _cannot_ open in a Worker/DO. So
instead:

1. A DO-backed `ToolBridgeProvisioner` is provided to `chat()`. The Claude Code
   adapter uses it instead of the default `node:http` provisioner.
2. The provisioner mints a per-run bearer token and returns a URL on the Worker's
   public hostname: `https://<PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>/_bridge/:runId?threadId=…`.
3. The agent's MCP calls hit that URL → the Worker forwards to the coordinator →
   the DO's `fetch` handler checks the token (constant-time **Web Crypto**
   compare, since `node:crypto.timingSafeEqual` is unavailable at the edge) and
   serves the JSON-RPC from the in-memory tool core.

No raw socket is ever opened; the bridge rides the same fetch surface as the rest
of the DO. The demo `tanstackStartRecipe` tool in `src/agent.ts` exercises this
path: the in-sandbox agent calls it before building. The recipe scaffolds with
`npx --yes @tanstack/cli create … --intent` (no global install needed — npm/npx
ship on the base image) — which writes **TanStack Intent** skill mappings into the
generated project for coding agents. (This is the fix for "the in-sandbox agent is
a bare install with none of your host skills": rather than ship the skill files,
provision them via the CLI at scaffold time.) The bridge still carries the
sandbox-specific guidance the generic skill can't know — build a no-env app, and
bind/expose the dev server for a preview URL.

## Run it locally

**Prerequisites:** Docker running (the plugin builds + runs the Container image
locally), Node 20+, `pnpm`, and the API key for your chosen `HARNESS` (defaults to
`claude-code` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; see [Choosing the harness](#choosing-the-harness)).

```bash
# 1) Install workspace deps (from the repo root)
pnpm install

# 2) From THIS directory, provide your key for local dev. The plugin reads
#    .dev.vars; the factory injects it into the sandbox env for the harness CLI.
cd examples/sandbox-cloudflare
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars      # then edit .dev.vars: set HARNESS + its key

# 3) (Optional) regenerate Cloudflare binding types after editing wrangler.jsonc
pnpm cf-typegen

# 4) Start the dev server — the Worker + Durable Objects + Container run in
#    workerd. First run builds the Dockerfile (installs the claude CLI; needs Docker).
pnpm dev                            # http://localhost:3001
```

> **No tunnel needed for local runs.** Agent runs work on plain `localhost` because
> the two host surfaces are reached locally without any public hostname:
>
> - **Bridge** (container → Worker `/_bridge` MCP server): the container reaches the
>   host machine at **`host.docker.internal:3001`** (the Docker host gateway). The
>   coordinator derives this automatically when the trigger arrives on `localhost`.
>   For this to work the dev server must listen on all interfaces, so `vite.config.ts`
>   sets **`server.host: true`** (bind `0.0.0.0`) — a default loopback-only bind makes
>   the container's `/_bridge` call fail with `ECONNREFUSED`.
> - **Preview** (browser → agent-built app): `exposePreview` opens a **Cloudflare
>   quick tunnel** (`*.trycloudflare.com`) served by `cloudflared` inside the
>   sandbox, so the preview link works without touching the dev server's port — no
>   wildcard DNS, no custom domain, even locally.
>
> So just `pnpm dev` and open `http://localhost:3001`. (`vite.config.ts` binds
> `0.0.0.0` and allows the `host.docker.internal` host; requires Docker Desktop
> running for the container — see Limitations.)

Open `http://localhost:3001` for the chat UI, or drive the agent's HTTP surface
directly:

```bash
# 1) Trigger — returns 202 immediately, the DO drives the agent in the background
curl -sX POST http://localhost:3001/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"threadId":"t1","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Build a self-contained TanStack Start kanban app (no env), run it, and return the preview URL."}]}'
# → { "runId": "..." }

# 2) Tail over WebSocket from the start (lastSeq=-1); reconnect with your last seq.
websocat "ws://localhost:3001/runs/<runId>/stream?threadId=t1&lastSeq=-1"

# 3) Or poll the status (non-streaming fallback)
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/runs/<runId>?threadId=t1"
```

**Deploying:** `pnpm deploy` and set the production key for your harness with
`wrangler secret put <KEY>` (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the default
`claude-code` — see [Choosing the harness](#choosing-the-harness)). The **agent
run** works with no host config —
the container reaches `/_bridge` over the request host, which is safe on Cloudflare
(the edge only routes hostnames you own to your Worker), so a `*.workers.dev` deploy
needs no `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`. **Preview URLs** work with no host config either — they
go over a quick tunnel (see below), so a `*.workers.dev` deploy is enough.

## Showing the app (preview URLs)

The agent builds and runs the app inside the container, then calls the
`exposePreview` host tool (`{ port: 5173 }`) once its dev server is up. That tool
runs on the host and opens a **Cloudflare quick tunnel** to that port via
`sandbox.tunnels.get(port)` — `cloudflared` (shipped in the `cloudflare/sandbox`
base image) serves it from inside the container — and returns a
`https://<name>.trycloudflare.com` URL the UI renders as a clickable **Open
preview** link.

For the tool to address the right container, the sandbox is pinned to the run's
`threadId` (see `src/sandbox-provider.ts`) instead of the default random id.

Why a tunnel instead of `exposePort`: `exposePort` + `proxyToSandbox` fronts the
preview on the Worker's origin, which in local dev is the Vite dev server — and
Vite's middleware then serves the preview's `/@vite/client`, `/src/*`, and `/@fs/*`
requests from your **host** instead of the container, breaking the page. A tunnel
bypasses the Vite port entirely, **needs no wildcard DNS or custom domain** (local
or deployed), and forwards WebSockets, so the built app's HMR works. The only
requirement — which `PREVIEW_GUIDANCE` tells the agent — is that the dev server
accept the tunnel host (`server: { host: true, allowedHosts: true }` for Vite).

> `exposePort` + `resolvePreviewHost` are still exported for apps that specifically
> want the Worker to front the preview on a custom domain (auth, response rewriting);
> that path needs a `*.<domain>` wildcard route + `PREVIEW_HOSTNAME`.

## Setting sandbox env

Which env vars get injected into the container is controlled by the `sandbox`
resolver in `src/agent.ts`: each `createSecrets({ … })` entry becomes an env var
the agent can read. (The demo app the agent builds needs none — the selected
harness's API key here is only for its CLI, i.e. the agent itself.)
Values come from the Worker `env`, so to add one:

1. add the value to `.dev.vars` (local) / `wrangler secret put` (prod), and
2. add the key to `createSecrets({ … })` (extend the env type if you want it typed
   — see the comment in `src/agent.ts`).

These are **host-controlled** secrets — the same for every user of the deployment.
There is no built-in lane for the browser user to set per-run secrets (the run
trigger only carries `threadId` + `messages`); see the note in **Limitations**.

---

## Limitations

Read these before treating this as production-ready. They are specific and
honest.

1. **Container → Worker bridge needs a reachable host.** The agent's container calls
   back to the Worker for the `/_bridge` MCP tool-bridge + `/tool-exec`: it just needs
   to _reach_ the Worker. **Local** → `host.docker.internal:3001` (Docker host gateway,
   http); **deploy** → the request host (no `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` needed; request-derivation
   is safe on Cloudflare because the edge only routes hostnames you own). A wrong
   `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` override surfaces as **"the tanstack MCP server hasn't come up"**
   (a 404 against the wrong host). Previews don't use this path — they go over a quick
   tunnel (see [Showing the app](#showing-the-app-preview-urls)), so they need no
   wildcard DNS or custom domain, local or deployed.
   - **Local requires Docker Desktop.** The container reaches the host via
     `host.docker.internal`, which Docker Desktop provides; some runtimes (e.g.
     OrbStack) can't run Cloudflare containers at all. There's also no Workers
     runtime in this monorepo's CI, so the app type-checks (`pnpm typecheck`) and
     builds against the real types and follows contracts proven by the package unit
     tests — but treat it as the _architecture blueprint_ until you've run it
     yourself. (Whether the CF sandbox container can actually reach
     `host.docker.internal` is the one thing to confirm on your machine.)

2. **The Cloudflare sandbox has no writable host→process stdin (handled).**
   Cloudflare background processes don't expose a writable stdin —
   `spawn().stdin.write` throws (see
   `packages/ai-sandbox-cloudflare/src/handle.ts`), advertised as
   `capabilities.writableStdin: false`. The Claude Code adapter normally pipes
   the prompt to `claude` over stdin (to keep it out of argv); when it sees
   `writableStdin: false` it instead writes the prompt to a file and redirects
   the CLI's stdin from it **in-shell** (`claude -p … < /tmp/prompt`). The
   redirection happens inside the container, so no host-side stdin write is
   needed and the prompt still never lands in argv. Claude Code therefore runs
   on the Cloudflare provider. (Duplex/interactive ACP harnesses that need
   ongoing two-way stdin — not Claude Code — would still need the future
   Cloudflare stdin path.)

3. **Container disk is ephemeral.** The Cloudflare sandbox's
   `durableFilesystem` capability is `false`, so the workspace is re-bootstrapped
   under the same identity across cold starts (`withSandbox` handles this). Don't
   assume files written in one run survive an eviction unless you persist them
   yourself.

4. **Sandbox env is host-controlled, not per-user.** The injected secrets (see
   [Setting sandbox env](#setting-sandbox-env)) come from the Worker `env` and are
   the same for every caller. The run trigger (`StartRunInput`) carries only
   `threadId` + `messages`, so there is no built-in lane for the browser user to
   supply their own secret for the app the agent builds. Adding one means dropping
   from the factory to the exported `ChatSandboxCoordinator`, overriding
   `config(input)` to read a per-thread secret you stashed in DO storage (via a
   small `POST` endpoint) — and treating it carefully: the sandbox runs
   LLM-authored code, so any injected secret is readable by the agent. Don't put
   one user's secret in a sandbox another user can reach.
